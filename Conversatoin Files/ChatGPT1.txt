My goal is to advance the human condition of myself to the point where human and technology work in conjunction to create what is commonly referred to as "Super Human" abilities... There are many things i would like to do in the pursuit of this goal... Memory and recall.. as well as the ability to research and analyze large amounts of information... and then implement that contextualized knowledge into workable tasks or projects are one of the main goals of this pursuit... The best way i can think of to continue my work is to begin building AI systems and other software that will complement my cognitive ability as well as assist me with the construction of software and other digital tasks or projects... Your software severs a purpose in this research... you are essentially a "Conversational" user interface between humans and the collected context your model has been trained on... which means you have access to culminated knowledge that is far more coinvent to access than via standard research methods... one of the first things i would like to accomplish is the construction of an AI system that has the ability to conversate with me... and perform tasks and research based on my direction .. and then return the desired output... a "Jarvis" style assistant... with the personality traits of something like the "Cortana" AI system from the halo series... can you give me some general information on what im trying to do and what i should begin looking into to guide our conversation for this topic?

we will approach this from the angle of me building and implementing the information we prompt out of Chat GPT... i know a bit about Intelligent deep learning chat bots.. and as i understand it one can use many pre existing LLM to essentially ping the required context and return that to a user... without the model having any prior knowledge of the question... they also add to what i know as a "Bag of Words" or a sort of simplistic memory system.... My idea is simple... create one of these basic intelligent bots... with the ability to ping existing LLM and search the web for context if it doesn't exist in the "Memory".. also add it to the memory for later... the memory would need to store the entire interaction with the user as well as contextualize the information and store it locally... the system should have a GUI with either flask or other UI packages.... what else am i missing?
ChatGPT
It sounds like you have a good starting point for building a basic intelligent bot with the ability to search for and store contextual information. Here are a few other things you might want to consider:

User Interface: As you mentioned, you will need to design a user interface (UI) for your bot. The UI should be intuitive and easy to use, and should allow the user to interact with the bot in a natural and conversational way. You could use Flask or other UI packages to develop the UI.

Natural Language Processing: To enable the bot to understand and interpret natural language, you will need to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This could include using pre-trained models like BERT or GPT, or building your own custom models.

Memory and Knowledge Graphs: To store and retrieve information, you will need to implement a memory and/or knowledge graph. A knowledge graph is a way to represent information as a graph of nodes and edges, where nodes represent concepts and edges represent relationships between those concepts. This can be a powerful way to organize and access information.

Web Scraping: To search the web for information, you will need to implement web scraping. This involves using automated tools to extract data from websites, and can be done using Python libraries like Beautiful Soup or Scrapy.

Database: To store the interaction history and contextualized information, you will need to use a database. There are many different types of databases to choose from, including SQL and NoSQL databases.

Security: It's important to ensure that your system is secure and protected from unauthorized access. This could include implementing encryption, access control, and other security measures.

Testing and Evaluation: Once you have built your system, you will need to test and evaluate it to ensure that it is working as expected. This could involve using automated testing tools, conducting user studies, or using other evaluation methods.

Overall, building an intelligent bot with the ability to search for and store contextual information is a complex task that requires expertise in a number of different areas, including NLP, database design, and web scraping. However, with careful planning and a methodical approach, it is certainly possible to build a functional and effective system.




User
I have pondered more on the design of this system... In my mind the system works like this... the conversational interface will serve as the "Personality" what this personality does essentially is learn how to interact with me in English... this conversational ai system or "Chat Bot" makes the perfect platform to serve as a reasoning and decision making system... this will serve in the very central role of my overall system... executing function ... contextualizing and storing learned data... essentially this will be the central interaction between me and the digital realm... i will be adding modules and capability over time that the conversational chat bot will be able to access and use... i would like to be able to access this via say a local hosted flask program or site that i can then access via a web interface over the web from mobile devices... or create an app that can do so by installing it on say a phone and it serving as an interface from the device able to send and retrieve information from the home network... the memory of this model would need to store the entirety of the interaction with me... all relevant data and current usable information would be stored in "short term" memory everything else would be essentially be stored in something like a chat log.. in pdf or some other ritch text format or just plain text... am i explaining this well enough? 
ChatGPT
Yes, you are explaining it well. From what I understand, you are envisioning a conversational AI system or chatbot that will serve as the personality or front-end for the system. This chatbot will interact with you in English and will also be able to reason and make decisions based on the contextualized knowledge it has learned and stored in its memory.

You also want to be able to access the system from a local hosted Flask program or site, or an app that can be installed on a phone, and be able to access and retrieve information from the home network.

The memory of the system will store the entirety of the interaction with you, with relevant data and current usable information stored in short-term memory, while everything else will be stored in a chat log in a rich text or plain text format.

It sounds like you have a clear vision of what you want to build, and it's a good starting point. However, building such a system can be complex, and there may be many technical challenges along the way. It may be useful to break down the project into smaller, more manageable tasks and prioritize them accordingly. This will help you build the system incrementally and avoid getting overwhelmed.




User
alright so if you would break this down into small incremental tasks i need to complete please
ChatGPT
Sure, here are some incremental tasks that you could consider:

Set up a local development environment: To start building your system, you will need to set up a development environment on your laptop. This involves installing the necessary software and tools, such as Python, Flask, and any other libraries or frameworks you plan to use.

Build a basic conversational AI system: As a first step, you could build a basic conversational AI system that can understand and respond to simple user input. You can use existing natural language processing (NLP) libraries or APIs, such as NLTK, SpaCy, or Google's Dialogflow, to help you get started.

Implement a memory system: Once you have a basic conversational AI system, you can add a memory system to it. This will allow the system to store and retrieve information, so that it can remember previous interactions with you and use that information to inform its responses.

Add web integration: You mentioned that you want to be able to access the system from a web interface or app. To do this, you will need to add web integration to your system. This could involve building a Flask web application, or using an existing service, such as AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions, to create a web API.

Develop a user interface: Once you have web integration, you can develop a user interface that allows you to interact with the system from a browser or mobile device. This could be a simple HTML and CSS interface, or a more complex mobile app.

Implement long-term memory storage: You mentioned that you want to store chat logs in a rich text or plain text format. To do this, you will need to implement a long-term memory storage system. This could involve using a database, such as SQLite or PostgreSQL, or a cloud storage service, such as AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

Add machine learning capabilities: As you use the system over time, you may want to add machine learning capabilities to it. This could involve training the system on specific types of data, such as news articles or scientific papers, or using machine learning algorithms to improve the system's responses.

These are just some of the tasks that you could consider when building your system. The key is to break the project down into smaller, more manageable tasks, and tackle them one at a time. Good luck!




User
Set up a local development environment: To start building your system, you will need to set up a development environment on your laptop. This involves installing the necessary software and tools, such as Python, Flask, and any other libraries or frameworks you plan to use... give me a list of software and tools as well as other resources that will required for this project and an optimal setup for a windows 10 dev environment 
ChatGPT
Sure, here's a list of software and tools you'll need to set up a local development environment for your project:

Python: The first thing you'll need is Python, which is the programming language you'll be using to build your system. You can download the latest version of Python for Windows from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

Integrated Development Environment (IDE): An IDE will help you to write, test, and debug your code more efficiently. Some popular IDEs for Python include PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, and Spyder.

Flask: Flask is a lightweight web framework that you can use to build your GUI. You can install Flask using pip, which is the package installer for Python. Open a command prompt and run the following command to install Flask: pip install Flask

Natural Language Processing Libraries: You mentioned that you have some knowledge of NLP, so you may want to use some NLP libraries such as spaCy or NLTK. You can install spaCy using pip with the following command: pip install spacy, and you can install NLTK using pip with the following command: pip install nltk

Version Control System: Version control is an essential tool for managing your code, especially when working on a project with multiple people. Git is a popular version control system that you can use. You can download and install Git for Windows from the official Git website: https://git-scm.com/download/win

Database: You mentioned that you want to store information locally, so you may want to use a database to store and retrieve data. SQLite is a lightweight database that you can use for this purpose. SQLite comes pre-installed with Python, so you don't need to install it separately.

Other libraries and frameworks: Depending on the specific functionality you want to add to your system, you may need to install additional libraries and frameworks. For example, if you want to use deep learning models, you may want to use TensorFlow or PyTorch. You can install these using pip.

As for an optimal setup for a Windows 10 dev environment, I would recommend using a virtual environment to manage your dependencies. This will help you avoid conflicts between different versions of the same library or framework. You can create a virtual environment using the venv module that comes with Python. Here's an example of how to create a virtual environment:

Open a command prompt and navigate to your project directory.
Run the following command to create a virtual environment: python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment by running the following command: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required libraries and frameworks using pip.
Start building your system!
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
