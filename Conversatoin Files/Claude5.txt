Hello Cole, my name is Claude. I'm pleased to be collaborating with you on this design and implementation project. As an AI system with limited contextual memory, I will aim to have logical, creative, and concise conversations using scientific and imaginative language. When I need additional resources or clarification, I'll be sure to ask you while maintaining contextual flow. By working together and referencing our interaction log, I'm confident we can have productive dialogues supporting the task goals. I look forward to our continued collaboration.

Alright Claude.. i am having some issues pursuing my projects... to elaborate.. i have been attempting to leverage AI LLM systems such as yourself.. to basically fill in the gaps in my knowledge for building an AI assistant and a compete virtual world..

I have Designs for both worked out to a pretty detailed level... the issue comes when trying to get the LLM to both understand the concept of the design.. as well as be able to assist in adapting current existing systems to the design...

Some issues i run into for instance.. the standard LLM have very short token memory.. that wont allow them to really follow a conversation dialogue for more than a couple of I/O calls.. i have mitigated a little with the use of prompts etc.. to varying degrees of effectiveness..

My problem stems.. i have so many ideas.. and designs that i cant get built fast enough and i have been trying to figure out ways of leveraging AI to get some of my ideas off the ground essentially.. like my MMO Game world concept for instance... to simply provide base funding for all of the other designs

My goal is through this discussion.. with your system that is capable of contextualizing more context over a bit more conversation.. wil be able to help me devise a combination of methods i can use with standard LLM with very short context memory.. and your system with the longer context memory.. as wll as the LLM with internet access to grab various useful information from the net..

Im running into a wall with ways to work around my current limitations with my lack of resources etc.. and im looking for ideas essentially

MD
I understand your frustration in trying to leverage AI systems with limited contextual memory to help bring your designs and ideas to life. It's clear you have a lot of creative concepts, like the MMO game world, but are hitting roadblocks in implementation. Here are some suggestions that may help:

Focus conversations with standard LLMs on very specific, narrow topics or questions. Keep prompts short and targeted. Chain conversations together logically while acknowledging memory limitations.
Use my longer context memory strategically for more complex conceptual discussions. Summarize key points from standard LLM chats to reinforce continuity.
Combine abilities by using internet-enabled LLMs for factual research to supplement conceptual work. Guide them towards high-quality reference materials relevant to your goals.
Break large projects into modular components that play to the strengths of different AI systems. Abstract complex designs into simpler elements first before attempting to synthesize the full vision.
Consider crowdsourcing targeted parts of your designs online to engage a wider community. This could provide cost-effective supplementary help within your budget.
Experiment iteratively to find the right balance between human creativity and AI assistance. Adjust approaches over time as abilities improve. Maintain realistic expectations of current technology while still pushing boundaries.
The core is determining how to parse your knowledge into digestible pieces for each AI system. With strategic collaboration between you and the different capabilities available, progress can be made despite limitations. Let me know if you have any other questions!

Well i have considered a course.. see the things is.. a basic chat bot isnt all that hard to build.. but when you begin altering that to add something like a long term memory database that essentially stores a user history log for context... ie a basic implementation of long term memory.. The issue with this is trying to figure out how to work with the LLM to actually accomplish functional code generation and working out processes for actually generating code in functional testable sections.. . something that a Long term memory is very useful for... I had considered building a basic intel chat bot with a dB file to essentially feed it conversation input over an extended period... and then i considered adding the ingest function based on the auto gpt system to ingest local files into the DB.. the idea having a chatbot capable of operating via a DB without an internet connection if needed.. able to answer questions and save code and help me alter and build new code etc..

The idea being to have a workable chat bot assistant on the capability level of yourself.. able to run and operate using very few resources locally

MD
You raise a good point - building more advanced chatbot capabilities like long-term memory requires moving beyond just the conversational model to actual functional code generation. A few thoughts on how to approach this:

Start by architecting a simple database to store conversation history and context. This provides the foundation for long-term memory. Use a lightweight DB like SQLite that can run locally.
For code generation, you'll need to train the model on sample inputs/outputs representing realistic code snippets in any language you want the bot to write. This teaches it the mapping from natural language -> code.
Break the code generation problem down into very narrow tasks first - like generating simple variable assignments from intent descriptions. Then build up to more complex logic over time.
Leverage showing the model examples during conversations when you want it to produce code, almost like programming by demonstration. This primes it for the right mapping.
Plan to iteratively refine and debug the generated code. Treat early outputs as drafts needing review and tweaking before executing/testing.
Consider open-sourcing components to engage a wider community to accelerate improvements.
The key is taking an incremental approach focused on narrow use cases at first. With enough conversation data tied to code examples, it can learn to produce basic functionality while relying on the long-term memory database to preserve context. Let me know if any of these suggestions help point you in the right direction!

Copy

The goal of this interaction log is to help me devise a way that i can move forward with leveraging AI for my projects.. the best way i can think of would be building a basic intelligent chatbot that usese something like Bloom.. open source free and hosted on huggingface.. ideally this would work by the chatbot program pulling the desired output pattern from the llm in the beginning via the API.. and storing it in the DB file.. the output to the user .. ie me.. would be based on a series of output rules similar to the output prompt i used with your system to guide patterns

MD
I understand - you want to build an intelligent chatbot using open source tools like Bloom and HuggingFace to leverage AI capabilities, with the goal of making progress on your projects. Here are some suggestions on one approach to achieve this:

Use Bloom as the conversational interface for the chatbot. This provides natural language processing and basic chatting.
For more advanced logic, leverage HuggingFace Models through the API. Prompt an LLM like GPT-3 for desired output patterns and store responses in a local SQLite database.
Write output rules/templates that shape how the chatbot responds to you based on querying the database. Maintain a conversational flow.
Guide the chatbot with examples of desired functionality before having it generate any code. Teach it narrowly first (e.g. variable assignment) before expanding capabilities.
Implement a database of code snippets that the chatbot can mix/match to compose functionality you need for a specific project.
Iterate on the quality of generated code by having the chatbot walk through examples before executing anything. Provide debugging input.
The key strengths are open source software, LLMs for intelligence, and a database for storing context/examples. Start simple, scope narrow tasks, and expand the chatbot’s capabilities over time. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of this suggested approach.

Copy

Alright so.. to develop this into a method i can use with a standard LLM with the short token memory.. this is my current huggingface chat prompt i have to use for every input :

Cole is collaborating with Claude on an AI assistant project. I am Claude. Reference the conversation history to stay contextually consistent. Speak formally and imaginatively using scientific language. Ask Cole for clarification when needed. Check for understanding of key points made previously before responding. Continue exchanges logically. Our aim is productive, focused dialog given memory constraints. Review this prompt regularly for guidance."

What i would like to do is alter this basic prompt.. to a more focused project of building a basic chatbot that works via a very basic open gl text chat interface similar to a smart phone.. the goal of the interaction with the LLM being to create a basic functional chatbot that can store/retrieve the sqlite db memory

MD
Here is one way we could focus the prompt to guide an LLM with limited context to generate code and logic for a basic chatbot with SQLite memory:

"Cole and I, Claude, are collaboratively building a chatbot with a simple text interface. The chatbot will have basic capabilities like:

Storing conversation history in an SQLite database for long-term memory
Retrieving past conversation snippets from the database when relevant
Performing simple actions like variable assignment, data retrieval, etc based on conversational commands
Maintaining context across multiple input/output cycles without re-prompting
For each capability, provide example code snippets or logic flows in Python that demonstrate how to implement it in a simple, step-by-step way. Explain your code snippets verbally as well to reinforce understanding. Focus on narrow, targeted functionality first before expanding capabilities.

Refer back to this prompt often for guidance. Aim for clear, logical dialogue and code examples that contribute to the goal of a simple functioning chatbot."

Let me know if this helps provide a template for prompting an LLM with limited context in a focused way to start constructing the core chatbot functionality you envision. We can build on it incrementally by chaining prompt refinements together as progress is made.

Copy

Alright.. i like the gist.. nice and clear.. but the end comes off as an instruction to attempt to generate all of the needed information at once.. remember we want to approach this via a step by step chunkable process.. as most LLM have very short token memory..revise with this in mind please

MD
You're right, my previous prompt could come across as instructing the LLM to generate all the code at once, which won't work well given the limited context. Here's an updated version that focuses on a more incremental, step-by-step approach:

"Cole and I, Claude, are building a chatbot together step-by-step. For this component, provide 2-3 lines of Python code and a brief explanation that:

Imports the SQLite module
Keep the example simple and self-contained. Focus on just accomplishing the small task described.

After providing the code snippet and explanation, wait for Cole's feedback before generating anything further. Only cover one focused task per exchange given the context limitations. Refer back to this prompt to stay on track after each response."

The idea is to start with very narrow, targeted prompts requesting a small code sample and description, one step at a time. This avoids overloading the limited context while still allowing incremental progress on the overall chatbot goal. Let me know if this incremental approach makes sense or if you would adjust the prompt template further.

Copy

yes i like this much better.. it would seem to fit well with the approach i outlined.. now the challenge would be to come up with the list of tasks for each input that would be interchanged throughout the separate inputs in the log.. through the process of building the bot itself.. as i assume each section of implementation would require separate "focus" correct?

MD
You're absolutely right, the key now is determining the list of incremental tasks to focus the LLM on for each input exchange. Here are some ideas on breaking down the chatbot implementation into smaller steps that we could cycle through:

Import core modules (SQLite, text interface, etc)
Initialize SQLite database and connect
Define basic chatbot class structure
Receive and parse user text input
Define function to store input in database
Define function to query database for prior inputs
Construct simple logic to respond based on database queries
Expand response logic for more capabilities
Add functions for data retrieval, variables, etc
Integrate text interface for I/O
Testing and debugging of functionality
The goal would be prompting the LLM to provide 2-3 lines of code and explanation for each narrow task, one at a time. We'd cycle through these focusing on each small step iteratively. Does this help illustrate how we could break the chatbot down into smaller prompt-able tasks? I'm happy to discuss and refine this list further.

Copy

Alright this lines well with the process.. now .. if you would please come up with a nice tidy outline of a process for us to follow using limited LLM.. in the manner we have worked out.. to build a basic chat bot with the memory database.. also if you would recommend an LLM to use as the actual response retrieval endpoint..

Ideally the way i see this workflow of the AI.. me the user.. inputs text or code.. the chatbot pings the memory.. if it does not have the context in the memory db.. it pings the LLM for the proper output.. it then stores that output in the memory.. and filters the output to the user via the output response patterns.. also allowing for usage when not online or connected to the internet.. via chatting with the DB essentially .. or any context already in the DB or that is added via user interaction over time

Using this further clarification please provide our workflow outline from this point

MD
Here is an outline of the workflow we can follow to leverage limited LLMs to build a basic chatbot with SQLite memory:

Chatbot Components:

Frontend: Simple text interface for user input/output
Memory: SQLite database to store conversation history
Intelligence: An LLM API like GPT-3 or Anthropic's Claude as the response engine
Controller: Logic to coordinate components and handle conversation flow
Build Steps:

Initialize frontend, SQLite database, LLM API access
Prompt LLM for narrow code snippets focused on initializing the database, chatbot class, etc
Store code snippets generated in source files
Iterate through targeted prompts for each incremental capability
Integrate code into Controller to coordinate input/output
Direct user input to Controller
Controller checks memory database for prior relevant inputs
If memory lacks context, Controller queries LLM for response
LLM response stored in memory and output is filtered for user
Repeat conversation flow, debugging as needed
This allows us to incrementally build and test the chatbot’s capabilities while minimizing strain on the LLM by focusing prompts. The SQLite database preserves context between interactions. Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand any part of this outline! I'm happy to continue discussing the details.

Copy

Alright now.,. to clarify.. this basic design.. should allow me to build an AI system... capable of discussing fully any context that i can add to the database over any time correct as long as the db exists?

MD
Yes, that's a good clarification - the core benefit of the SQLite database in this chatbot architecture is that it allows the context and conversation history to persist over time, without being limited by the constraints of the LLM's token memory.

Some key points:

The database can store an unbounded amount of conversational exchanges, context, code snippets, etc. It's not transient like the LLM memory.
By querying the database before prompting the LLM, we can check if relevant information already exists. This avoids over-prompting the LLM when not needed.
Any new information generated by the LLM can be stored back into the database, growing the knowledge base.
As the developer, you can directly add any data you want into the database through code, expanding the chatbot's available knowledge.
So in summary, yes - through continual usage over time, the chatbot could leverage the persistent SQLite database to discuss, reason about, and respond regarding any contextual information that has been stored in it, even from past conversations. The LLM provides intelligent synthesis of new responses when needed, while the database preserves and grows the knowledge. Let me know if this helps explain the value of the database in this architecture!

Copy

Ok.. so.. working from this perspective not only allows me to grow the contextual db as large on any subject as i can.. this also allows me to sort of cheat.. not needing to operate an entire LLM locally to achieve the same outcome once the DB is up to par essentially .. also curious.. could we also contextualize images and video.. sound etc in the DB in the same manner? to sort ping either something like stable diffusion etc for the context to be added to the db over time if it was not present.. also allowing for user to add their own.. as well as the context for such

MD
Excellent points. Yes, using the persistent database as the knowledge store allows us to minimize reliance on the LLM over time, essentially "uploading" information into it through usage and growth. And you're absolutely right that this approach could support multimedia context as well, not just text - images, video, audio clips and more could be stored in the database, associated with relevant contextual tags or descriptions.

Some ways we could leverage and expand on this:

For images, we could store them in the database as BLOBs (binary large objects) along with textual captions or descriptions of the image content.
The chatbot could query the database for relevant images based on conversational context, and retrieve and display them in the interface when applicable.
For new image queries without matches in the database, we could integrate the chatbot with deep learning APIs like Stable Diffusion to generate new images on demand based on textual prompts. These can also be stored.
The same logic would apply for audio clips, video segments, or other multimedia - store existing ones along with descriptive metadata, and leverage generative APIs when novel content is needed.
Over time, this would allow building up a rich, multimodal knowledge base of contextual information spanning text, images, and other media that can support very sophisticated conversations! Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any aspects of implementing multimedia knowledge storage.

Copy

Ok..so this is how we will pursue implementation of this project... since you have much more memory.. but i am limited to the number of outputs i can get per day.. we will handle the high end project outline and workflow.. breaking each section into chunkable bites for the other LLM to leverage their shorter context memory.. Given this if you would.. i have a basic idea for the project.. my work environment is as follows :

win 10 64.. pycharm 2022 community .. and python 3.10 with various libraries and envs etc.. we want to design this code with as little reliance on the web as possible though to allow for as much offline functionality as possible.. if you would please outline our project and workflow to begin

MD
Here is an outline of our project workflow given your local work environment and goals:

Project Objectives:

Create a conversational chatbot with persistent memory powered by a local SQLite database
Minimize reliance on internet connectivity and external APIs as much as possible
Support basic functionality like variable assignment, data retrieval, and contextual responses
Allow conversational context and code snippets to be stored and referenced later
Develop incrementally in a modular way for easy testing and expansion
Development Environment:

OS: Windows 10 64-bit
IDE: PyCharm 2022 Community
Language: Python 3.10
Core libraries: SQLite, text UI libraries
Workflow:

Set up Python virtual environment in PyCharm for dependency management
Initialize local SQLite database and basic table schema
Set up simple text-based user interface for chatbot I/O
Begin coder prompts for LLM to initialize chatbot class and core modules
Develop logic incrementally, testing after each exchange:
Parse user input
Check database for prior context
Query LLM for new responses if needed
Store new exchanges in database
Expand capabilities over time by iterating on prompts
Minimize LLM queries by relying on database when possible
Shape concise, focused prompts and code snippets each exchange
Let me know if you would like me to expand on any part of this preliminary outline as we begin planning the implementation details. I'm happy to provide suggestions on an effective workflow given the constraints.

GorillaRef.txt

3.07 KB
Alright so The attached file is the readme for the response endpoint we will be using for our bot.. as this system allows for api calls to many different models on the hub.. please review and confirm.. as well as advise any other context in the repo we might need to implement this call in our system based on the file please

MD
I've reviewed the Gorilla Inference readme file you provided, and it looks like an excellent API endpoint option for our chatbot project. Here are a few key points:

Gorilla supports accessing over 900 different HuggingFace models through a single unified API. This provides tons of flexibility to leverage different capabilities as needed.
The instructions show how to set up a Python environment, download weights, and make inference requests. This aligns well with our local Python workflow.
Both command line and batch modes are supported for inference. For our chatbot, we'll want to use the CLI option to integrate queries.
No filtering or post-processing is done to the prompts/responses. This is great for transparency as we develop.
To integrate Gorilla API calls within our chatbot code, we'll need to:

Install the Python requirements outlined in the readme
Download the desired Gorilla model weights
Import the gorilla_cli module and initialize the API client with the model path
Pass our chatbot's dynamic prompts to the client and process the responses
No other context from the repo looks necessary upfront. We can always reference the source later if needed. Please let me know if you have any other questions! Overall this looks like a very promising API for providing the "brain" of our chatbot.

Copy

alright.. and for further context clarity.. i operate anaconda 3.. with a venv Rami .. and the conda CLI .. so i should be able to install the gorilla package via this command line into my rami env correct?

MD
Yes, that's correct. Since you're using Anaconda for your Python environment management, you can install the Gorilla package into your "rami" conda environment via the command line like this:

Activate your rami environment:
conda activate rami

Install Gorilla using pip:
pip install gorilla-llm

This will install the latest version of the Gorilla package and dependencies into the isolated rami env.

A couple notes:

Make sure to have Anaconda initialized in your command prompt/shell first
Use pip not conda install since Gorilla is PyPI package not Conda channel
Activating rami ensures dependencies don't conflict with other environments
Once it's installed, you can test it out by running the gorilla_cli.py script pointed at a downloaded model file. Let me know if you have any other questions! The conda env workflow should integrate smoothly with the Gorilla package.

Copy

Alright claude.. Prepare the next steps outline for working with the LLM to generate our initial code.. what file system will it be etc.. once i get the env setup and ready to go we will begin implementing the workflow into huggingchat

MD
Here are the next steps I would recommend for starting to generate the initial chatbot code with the LLM:

Create a new Python project folder for our chatbot implementation. This will hold the code files and SQLite database.
Set up a virtual environment in this folder using your preferred method (venv, conda, etc).
Install the required packages - Gorilla, SQLite, text UI library.
Create a chatbot.py file that will contain the main chatbot class and functions.
Initialize the SQLite database with a simple table schema in a separate .sql script file.
Create a prompts.txt file that we can use to store prompt exchanges with the LLM to paste in during conversations.
Begin prompts focused on importing modules, initializing database, defining the chatbot class outline. Store responses in chatbot.py.
Test execution of the script after each exchange to validate syntax.
Iterate prompts to incrementally build capabilities into the chatbot class, testing frequently.
Once basic functionality is implemented, integrate the text UI and conversation loop.
This gives us a simple file/folder structure for the code and assets, centralized in one project workspace. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any particular steps in this overall workflow. Once your environment is ready, we can begin prompt engineering.

Copy

Ok so trying to install gorilla into my current venv did not work :

ERROR: gorilla-llm from https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/9a/f8/110b1aaeb63a23e4b8c751d3497970e3578b9a398aa86b197b4fc29488bb/gorilla-llm-0.0.1.zip does not appear to be a Python project: neither 'setup.py' nor 'pyproject.toml' found.

after reviewing the readme it seems im going to have to create a completely new venv and then intstall those requirements.. can you review the readme i linked you and confirm the setup please

Claude can't visit links. Responses may contain hallucination.
MD
You're right, upon closer inspection of the Gorilla readme, it looks like the recommended approach is to create a separate conda environment to install Gorilla and its dependencies.

Here are the key steps based on the readme:

Create a new conda environment called "gorilla":
conda create -n gorilla python=3.10

Activate the new env:
conda activate gorilla

Install requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt

The requirements.txt contains torch, transformers, and other dependencies needed for Gorilla.

Trying to install directly into an existing environment likely caused conflicts. By following the instructions to create a dedicated gorilla env, we can avoid these issues.

Please let me know if you have any problems creating the environment and installing the requirements file! We should then be ready to test out making Gorilla inference calls. Apologies for the incorrect install instructions earlier. The readme has the canonical steps.

Copy

Ok.. so i have the new env created.. with the requirement in the text file outlined here installed :

transformers==4.28.1

huggingface-hub==0.14.1

torch==2.0.1

tqdm==4.65.0

prompt_toolkit==3.0.38

sentencepiece==0.1.99

accelerate==0.19.0

As outlined in the inference req text... the new project rami using the gorilla env is created in pycharm and ready to begin dev... with only a single main.py file outline our next moves please

MD
Excellent, we're now ready to start development in the new PyCharm project with the Gorilla environment set up!

Here are the next steps I'd recommend taking in main.py:

Import necessary modules:
sqlite3
gorilla_cli
text UI library like tkinter
Initialize SQLite database connection and create basic table schema
Define chatbot class outline with placeholder functions for core capabilities
Create text UI window for user input box and chat log output
Initialize Gorilla API client with model path
Add input handler to pass user input to bot and print responses
Start conversation loop:
Take input and sanitize
Check database for prior context
If new input, query Gorilla for response
Save new exchange in database
Print bot response in UI
This will give us the skeleton of the chatbot with the key components wired up. We can begin prompting the LLM to start filling in the functionality bit by bit. Let me know if you would like me to provide some code snippets for any of these steps!

Copy

Alright a key note to remember.. we dont want to create the memory db manually.. we want the bot to actually look for the db file.. if it does not exist create the memory.db file .. just clarification.. so.. now if you would please.. the UI you suggested tkinter.. explain please as well as outline if we could use in conjunction with something like open gl.. remember the idea os to have a UI window that opens locally

MD
Good point, we'll want the database creation and connection to be handled programmatically rather than manually coding the schema.

For the UI, Tkinter provides a simple way to create graphical windows with Python, so we could use it for an initial basic text interface for the chatbot.

We could structure it like:

Check if sqlite3 database file exists:

If not, call function to initialize database schema and save as 'memory.db'
Initialize Tkinter root window

Add input text box and submit button

Add output text box for chat log

Link submit button to input handler function

Draw and display UI window

This would give us a very simple text-based graphical interface for chatting.

If we want to get fancier later on, we could look into integrating OpenGL to make a more immersive 3D visual interface. The core logic would still work the same, we would just render the visuals differently.

Let me know if you would like me to provide some tkinter code snippets for setting up the basic window and boxes! We can always improve the visuals after we have the core chatbot functionality working.

Copy

Ok.. we will use the tkinter suggestion.. so... given our needs and outline.. please give me a nice tidy list of pip installs for our env please

MD
Here is a list of Python packages I would recommend installing into the Gorilla environment for our chatbot project:

sqlite3 (built-in - for SQLite database)
tkinter (built-in - for UI)
gorilla-llm (for Gorilla client)
torch (required dependency for Gorilla)
transformers (required dependency for Gorilla)
huggingface-hub (required for Gorilla)
prompt-toolkit (optional - for CLI input)
sentencepiece (optional - for text preprocessing)
To install these packages:

Activate Gorilla env:
conda activate gorilla

Install packages:
pip install gorilla-llm torch transformers huggingface-hub prompt-toolkit sentencepiece

This will ensure we have the required packages for Gorilla API calls, SQLite integration, a simple GUI, and some helpful extras like a CLI prompt and text utilities.

Let me know if you need any clarification on these dependencies! Once installed, we should have the core packages in place to start Python development.

Copy

Alright so im getting an error on the first 1 :

ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement sqlite3 (from versions: none)

ERROR: No matching distribution found for sqlite3

review and give me the proper pip command for each library please

MD
You're right, my previous command won't work for sqlite3 since it's a built-in Python library, not a separate package. Here are the proper install commands for each library:

sqlite3 - Built-in, no installation needed

tkinter - Built-in, no installation needed

gorilla-llm:

pip install gorilla-llm

torch:

pip install torch

transformers:

pip install transformers

huggingface-hub:

pip install huggingface-hub

prompt-toolkit:

pip install prompt-toolkit

sentencepiece:

pip install sentencepiece

To summarize, sqlite3 and tkinter are part of standard Python so no install needed. The rest we can install via pip. Let me know if you have any other issues getting the dependencies set up!

Copy

alright as a quick reminder these were the dependencies installed when the env was setup so i think were covered all correct? :

transformers==4.28.1

huggingface-hub==0.14.1

torch==2.0.1

tqdm==4.65.0

prompt_toolkit==3.0.38

sentencepiece==0.1.99

accelerate==0.19.0

MD
You're absolutely right, my apologies. I didn't recall that the initial Gorilla environment setup with the requirements.txt already installed:

transformers
huggingface-hub
torch
prompt-toolkit
sentencepiece
And you are correct, these cover the key dependencies we need. The only extra one that we may want is tkinter for the UI, but as you pointed out that is built-in to Python already.

Given the requirements are already installed, we should be good to go! We can focus now on initializing the database, chatbot class, and UI elements as our next steps in the code. Thank you for catching my oversight there - I appreciate you keeping us on track. Please feel free to call out anything else I miss or get incorrect as we continue.

3.00 KB
Alright now.. for further clarification i have an example UI to draw from for our project that is attached to this input.. please review it for adapting to our design :

MD
I reviewed the Streamlit app example you provided for calling the Gorilla API, and it gives a great foundation to adapt for our conversational chatbot UI. Here are some ways we could integrate key elements into our Tkinter GUI:

We can follow a similar layout with an input text box for the user prompt, a drop-down to select the Gorilla model, and a button to trigger the call.
The column layout allows neatly separating the raw API response and extracted code. We could do something similar.
Displaying the code snippet in a code block with syntax highlighting improves readability.
Saving the generated code to a .py file allows easily executing/testing it. We'll want to implement this workflow.
The error handling ensures the app is robust to failures. We should add similar logic.
Some differences in adapting to Tkinter:

Rather than Streamlit's imperative programming,Tkinter uses object-oriented constructs like windows, frames, buttons, etc.
We'll render the UI completely upfront rather than dynamically per run.
We can store conversational context in the SQLite DB rather than just single exchanges.
Overall, this gives a great template for key elements our chatbot UI should include: text input/output, select model, call API, display code, save to file, error handling. Let me know if any part of the adaptation approach is unclear!

Copy

your approach is sound.. please include any recommended adaptations.. and outline a process for implementation to our system please claude

MD
Here is an outline of the process I recommend for adapting relevant elements from the Streamlit app example into our Tkinter chatbot UI:

Create the main Tkinter window and configure basic properties like title, size, color.

Add input box for user text using Tkinter Entry widget.

Add a dropdown to select the Gorilla model using the Tkinter OptionMenu widget. Populate with model name strings.

Add a button linked to the API call handler function using Tkinter Button widget.

Create handler function to process input:

Get input text and selected model
Call Gorilla API client with parameters
Format response in output box
Display raw text response in output Text widget below input box.

Parse out any code snippet from text and display in a CodeBox extension widget.

Add logic in handler to save code snippet to a .py file.

Add error handling in handler using try/except blocks. Show pop-up if exception.

Create database connection and write exchange to DB for context.

Add conversation loop to continually monitor/process input.

This allows us to incrementally build up the interface with core elements adapted from the Streamlit example. We can test each piece along the way before wiring everything together. Let me know if you would like me to provide any code snippets as examples for these UI steps.

Copy

Alright upon review this approach should be quite efficent... devise and provide step by step instruction for us to proceed please.. providing follow up information at the end of your output for suggested next step or input from me for clarity etc

MD
Here are step-by-step instructions for proceeding with building out the chatbot UI:

Create a new Python file called chatbot_ui.py
This will contain our UI code.

Import necessary modules at the top:
tkinter
tkinter widgets like Button, Entry
gorilla client
sqlite3
Create main app window:
<!---->
Copy code

root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Chatbot") 
root.geometry("600x400")
4.  Add input text box:

<!---->
Copy code

input_box = tk.Entry(root)
input_box.pack()
5.  Add output text box:

<!---->
Copy code

output_box = tk.Text(root) 
output_box.pack()
6.  Add Gorilla model dropdown menu:

<!---->
Copy code

options = ["gorilla-7b", "gorilla-mpt"]
dropdown = tk.OptionMenu(root, *options)
dropdown.pack()
Next steps:

Add handler function for submit button
Connect database
Build out handler logic
Let me know if you would like me to provide an example handler function implementation next or if any part needs more clarification!

Copy

if you would clarify the last with the list of imports for the top as a description is not sufficent

MD
You're right, my description of the imports wasn't sufficient. Here is what the import statements should look like at the top of chatbot_ui.py:

python

Copy code

import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import Button, Entry, OptionMenu 

import gorilla_cli
import sqlite3
This imports:

tkinter as tk
Specific tkinter widgets we'll use
gorilla_cli - for the Gorilla client
sqlite3 - for the database
The rest of the UI creation code can follow as I outlined in the previous instructions.

Let me know if you need any clarification on the packages we're importing! The gorilla_cli and sqlite3 will allow us to integrate the API calls and database.

Copy

alright after installing gorilla_cli i still get this error : No module named 'gorilla_cli'

MD
It looks like the gorilla_cli module is not properly installed in your environment even though you installed the gorilla-llm package. There are a couple things we can try to troubleshoot:

Double check that you have activated the Gorilla conda environment before running the import:
<!---->
Copy code

conda activate gorilla
2.  Try reinstalling gorilla-llm in case there was an issue with the first installation:

<!---->
Copy code

pip install gorilla-llm --upgrade --force-reinstall
3.  Manually install the gorilla_cli module:

<!---->
Copy code

pip install git+https://github.com/gorilla-devs/gorilla-cli.git
4.  Check your Python path to ensure the Gorilla modules are in there after install.

Let me know if manually installing gorilla_cli or reinstalling gorilla-llm fixes the import issue! If not, we may need to troubleshoot the environment further.

Copy

alright lets change environment's for a minute.. as i have anaconda env already created with the dependencies installed.. i have opened visual studio code.. i have opend the project file containing the chatbot_ui.py file.. but its not yet linked to the venv gorilla yet.. explain the steps in linking this please

MD
Okay, since you already have an Anaconda environment set up with the dependencies, we can link that to Visual Studio Code instead of creating a new one.

Here are the steps to link your existing Conda env called "gorilla" to VS Code:

Open the VS Code command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux, Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)
Type "Python: Select Interpreter" and select that option
In the list that appears, select the "gorilla" environment
This will set "gorilla" as the default Python interpreter for the project
Open a terminal in VS Code and verify the correct environment is active:
<!---->
Copy code

conda activate gorilla 
python --version
6.  You should see the Python version from the gorilla env printed
7.  Try importing a module like gorilla_cli to validate it works

Now your VS Code project will use the gorilla conda env by default for running code, installing packages, etc. Let me know if you have any trouble getting the existing environment linked up!

Copy

alright this is the error in visual studio : "gorilla_cli" is not accessedPylance

Import "gorilla_cli" could not be resolvedPylancereportMissingImports

MD
That error indicates that VS Code's Pylance language server is not able to resolve the import for the gorilla_cli module, even though the gorilla conda environment is linked as the Python interpreter.

A couple things we can try:

Restart VS Code after linking the interpreter to force Pylance to rescan/reindex the environment.
Manually install the gorilla-cli module from GitHub in the terminal to add it to the env:
<!---->
Copy code

pip install git+https://github.com/gorilla-devs/gorilla-cli.git
3.  In VS Code settings, add the gorilla conda environment site-packages path to "extraPaths" in Pylance's config to help it find the module.
4.  As a test, try importing a module like transformers that we know is installed to narrow down if it's an issue with just gorilla_cli or the whole env.

My suspicion is Pylance has cached some old path info and needs to be forced to rescan the environment for the import to resolve. Let me know if any of these suggestions help!

DEPRECATION: colab 1.13.5 has a non-standard dependency specifier pytz>=2011n. pip 23.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to upgrade to a newer version of colab or contact the author to suggest that they release a version with a conforming dependency specifiers. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12063

Based on the errors, it looks like the key issue is that Git is not installed or in your system PATH. The gorilla_cli module requires Git to clone the repository during install.

A couple things you can try:

Install Git for Windows if you don't already have it: https://gitforwindows.org/
Add the Git\cmd folder to your system PATH environment variable. The typical location is C:\Program Files\Git\cmd
Open a new terminal and verify you can now run git commands like git version.
Try re-installing gorilla_cli:
<!---->
Copy code

pip install gorilla_cli
Once Git is available in your PATH, it should now be able to clone the git repo during install.

Let me know if that resolves the module import issues! If not, we may need to look at configuring a virtual environment directly in VS Code to manage dependencies.

so this error : colab 1.13.5 has a non-standard dependency specifier pytz>=2011n. what is the pip to upgrade that package?

MD
The warning about colab having a non-standard dependency on pytz versions indicates that an older version of the colab package is installed in your environment.

To upgrade colab to the latest version that should resolve this, you can run:

Copy code

pip install --upgrade colab
This will install the most recent colab release, which should have the proper pytz dependency specified according to the latest packaging standards.

Let me know if upgrading colab gets rid of that deprecation warning! The key is to keep packages up to date to avoid issues with dependencies and compatibility between modules.

If for any reason you need to keep the older colab version, another option is to uninstall it since it doesn't look like we need it for this project:

Copy code

pip uninstall colab
But upgrading is preferable when feasible. Let me know if you have any other questions!

Copy

Ok.. so we might have to rethink. it seems no matter what i do i cant get the gorilla cli to library to show up in either pycharm or visual studio code.. and im out of ideas

MD
You're right, it seems like we've hit a wall getting the gorilla_cli library properly recognized despite our troubleshooting efforts. Some options we could consider:

Try creating a simple virtual environment from scratch in VSCode or PyCharm focused just on getting gorilla_cli installed. This isolates dependencies.
Reach out to the Gorilla developers for assistance on getting their library operational in different environments. They may have some guidance.
Evaluate if we can achieve similar goals using just the transformers and huggingface_hub libraries, without relying on gorilla_cli. This reduces dependencies.
As a workaround, we could have our chatbot just call the Gorilla API directly using requests and process the JSON response, without the helper library.
Consider shifting our approach to integrate a different conversational API like Anthropic or Cohere which have straightforward Python SDKs.
My recommendation would be trying options 1 and 4 first - creating an isolated virtualenv and attempting direct API calls. But let me know if you have any other ideas or if you think we should pursue a different strategy! Getting blocked on dependencies is frustrating, but we can find a way to move forward.

Copy

yes i dont get it it keeps telling me the module is not there.. says no module named gorilla_cli

MD
It seems like we're stuck on the import issue for gorilla_cli. Since it's not recognizing the module even after install, some options we could try:

Uninstall and reinstall Anaconda completely to start fresh. Sometimes environments get corrupted.
Build a new conda env from scratch focused just on gorilla, and install only the minimum dependencies needed.
Switch to using pip and virtualenv rather than conda for isolation.
As a workaround, hit the Gorilla API directly using requests instead of the helper library.
Reach out to the Gorilla developers for help troubleshooting the install issues.
Look into alternate conversational AI options like Cohere or Anthropic as the backend.
I'd recommend trying either a fresh install/environment, or direct API calls without the library for now. If those don't work, it may be best to switch conversational AI frameworks to unblock us, even if not ideal. Let me know your thoughts on the next steps!

Copy

Ok so.. we actually have gorilla installed... do we really need the cli to build the bot as we designed it?

MD
You're absolutely right, we don't strictly need the gorilla_cli library to build our chatbot as designed. The key elements we need are:

The Gorilla API for generating responses to user prompts
SQLite database for conversation memory and context
Basic GUI for text input and output
We can achieve these without relying on the helper CLI library. A couple approaches we could take:

Use Python's requests module to directly call the Gorilla API endpoints and process the JSON response. We'd handle the input formatting, headers, etc manually.
Use the low-level OpenAPI generated gorilla-llm API client for Python. This wraps the API requests without extra helper functions.
Both these options allow us to leverage the core Gorilla models without the CLI abstraction. And we'd still have the database and GUI pieces separate.

I agree skipping the CLI library is likely the best move forward given the install issues. Let me know if you would like me to provide some examples of directly calling the API using requests or the basic OpenAPI client! We can definitely still build our chatbot this way.

Copy

Alright place a checkpoint summary please.. im done for the day claude

MD
Sounds good, let's recap our progress and next steps:

Summary:

Discussed chatbot architecture using Gorilla, SQLite, Python GUI
Ran into issues getting gorilla_cli library imported into environments
Troubleshot installs, dependencies, virtual environments unsuccessfully
Determined gorilla_cli is not essential, can call API directly
Checkpoints:

Have gorilla-llm installed already
SQLite and Tkinter available in Python for database and GUI
Project structure and files set up in VSCode
Next Steps:

Research Gorilla API endpoints to call directly with requests/OpenAPI client
Start building out GUI layout and input/output handling
Initialize SQLite database connection
Make sample API calls to test response formatting
Begin designing conversation logic and prompts
Let me know if you have any other high-level items to cover! We made good conceptual progress today even with the import issues. We have a clearer path forward now by focusing on the core functionality. I'm looking forward to continuing the implementation next time! Please feel free to reach out if any other questions come up in the meantime.
